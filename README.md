Optional homework for machine learning

### Objective: Build a machine learning model

As this homework is optional, I didn't spend to much time to solve the problem in details. 
I built a GridSearch model and played with grid parameters to tune the model. 

I applied three sets of paramaters: 

- set 1:<br>
![par_base.PNG](Images/par_base.PNG)<br>

- set 2: <br>
![par_refine.PNG](Images/par_refine.PNG)<br>

- set 3:<br>
![par_refine2.PNG](Images/par_refine2.PNG)<br>


Scores obtained for: 
- set 1:<br>
![score_base.PNG](Images/score_base.PNG)<br>

- set 2: <br>
![score_refine.PNG](Images/score_refine.PNG)<br>

- set 3:<br>
![score_refine2.PNG](Images/score_refine2.PNG)<br>


### Conclusion
Tuning hyper-parameters to obtain a better model is time demanding. Trying to optimize parameters to obtain a better model might not be so meaningful as the amount of additional information is small.
